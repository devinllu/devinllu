Hey there! Welcome to my page.

My name is Devin and I'm currently a developer @ Brock Solutions. I'm a recent computer science graduate and software engineer. I mainly enjoy working on applications in Python (mainly due to the versatility of the language), but I'm quick to adapt to new tech stacks.

Feel free to check out my personal website (https://devinllu.github.io/) to learn more or shoot me a message if you'd like to chat!
